This isn't really a serious project, though it's pretty neat and is actually pretty convenient. However it has a bunch of minor bugs, bad design and there are still many features that I could add but I'm simply done with the project and don't want to deal with the bad code base anymore.
If you want though, fell free to download and modify the project.
This repository contains the main folder of the project so you would need to create a new project and migrate with this folder. But all other files just aren't needed since I have neither any libraries nor some fancy gradle logic or tasks.
Anyway feel free to explore and have a nice day!
